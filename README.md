# Pazarama OMDB Project

Pazarama OMDB Project is an iOS application that demonstrates various key development concepts and design patterns using Swift and UIKit.

## Features

- Programmatic UI with Swift UIKit.
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.
- Protocol-oriented programming.
- Dependency injection.
- Delegate pattern.

The application fetches movie data from an API and presents it on the home page using pagination. Users can select a movie to view its details, where additional information and features are provided.

Additionally, a Favorites feature is implemented using UserDefaults, allowing users to save their preferred movies for easy access.
